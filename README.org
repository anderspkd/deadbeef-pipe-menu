#+TITLE: DeadBeef pipe menu for openbox

As the title says: A pipe menu for controlling [[http://deadbeef.sourceforge.net/][DeadBeef]].

* Usage

  Include the following ~menu~ element somewhere in your
  ~openbox_menu~ definition in ~menu.xml~

  #+begin_src: xml
  <menu id="someId" label="someLabel" execute="/path/to/db-pipe.py"/>
  #+end_src

  Can optionally be supplied a directory containing playlists with the
  ~-p~ switch.

* Functionality

  DeadBeef doesn't really support that many functions from a
  commandline (unless I missed something). Currently supports

  - Playing a playlist (if started with ~-p /some/playlist/dir~).
  - Toggle play/pause.
  - Go to next song.
  - Go to previous song.
  - Select random song
  - Stop song

  Obviously also supports quitting out of deadbeef.

  The menu has two different layouts, depending on whether or not
  deadbeef is currently running.
